                        Dreams are like our lives - they come on in an instant, are very powerful,
                        <br/>
                        but often make no sense at all or are sexually deviant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dreams are what days are made of,
                        <br/>
                        but as we move on to the different stages of our lives,
                        <br/>
                        it's time to get rid of old dreams and invest in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is especially true of older family members,
                        <br/>
                        who work their whole lives to amass possessions and
                        <br/>
                        wealth that they will be too senile to enjoy.
                        <br/><br/>
                        That's where we come in! 
                        <br/>
                        Helping you turn that useless cash into literal wind through your hair.
                        <br/>
                        So many television shows celebrate the new found wealth 
                        <br/>
                        in an old barn or attic - keepsakes that were literally
                        <br/>
                        gathering dust and doing nobody any good.
